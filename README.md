# Generative-AI-Prompt-Engineering-Basics

In this module, I learned about the concept of prompt engineering in generative AI. I explored best practices for writing effective prompts and assessed several prompt engineering tools.

I discovered techniques for crafting prompts that guide generative AI models more effectively, and I explored different approaches that help enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.

The module included a graded quiz, which helped me reinforce my understanding of the key concepts, as well as a glossary to support my comprehension of generative AI terms.

I also worked on a final project, which gave me hands-on experience with the prompt engineering techniques covered throughout the course.

There was also optional content that I found helpfulâ€”particularly the techniques for writing prompts specifically for image generation. I also explored Prompt Lab, a tool in IBM watsonx that helps improve the effectiveness of prompt engineering.
